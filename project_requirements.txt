Smart-Inventory & Dispatch Manager Project Description
ðŸ”¹ Overview
 
Smart-Inventory & Dispatch Manager is a complete solution for managing stock, vehicles and driver allocations with route planning.
The system helps businesses efficiently track inventory, manage deliveries, and optimize operations without 
requiring credit card/debit card APIs. It leverages open-source tools (like OpenStreetMap & OSRM) for route mapping.
 
ðŸ”¹ Core Features
 
1) Inventory Management : 
 
   a) Add, update,delete  and search stock items.
 
   b) Maintain Dispatched stock to desitnation Hub . 
 
   c) Low stock alerts/notifications
 
   d) Maintain purchase( When adding Items ) and sales records(Dispatched item from source Hub).
 
2) Vehicle Management : 
 
   a) Register vehicles with details (number, type, capacity).
 
   b) Track availability status (Available / Allocated / Under Maintenance).
 
   c) Assign vehicles to delivery routes.
 
3) Driver Management :
 
   a) Register drivers with details (name, license, contact , age (if age>50 dont allow to Register, salary).
 
   b) Track driver availability.
 
   c) Allocate drivers to vehicles for deliveries.

   d) Alert if any driver age is greater than 50 than update the status field = Reteried.

4) Hub  :
   
   a) Register Hub with details ( Hub_ID, Hub_name , Hub_Manger , Hub_phone no , Hub _ address ). (CRUD operations )

   b) Maintain Hub status whether it is Active / InActive .
 
5) Route Management (No Paid APIs) : 
 
  a) Use OpenStreetMap (OSM) + OSRM / Leaflet.js for route planning.
 
  b) Plan delivery routes with pickup(Dispatched Hub) and desitnation Hub.
 
  c) Estimate travel time and distance.
 
No login or payment required â€” fully open source.

Future Enchancments : Register, login (admin based  and user based).
 

 
ðŸ”¹ Development Levels
Level 1 â€“ Basic Development

 a) Build Hub module (add/update/delete/search).
 
 b) Build inventory module (add/update/delete/search items).
 
 c)Enable low stock alert notifications.
 
 d) Implement simple vehicle and driver registration.
 
 e) Basic allocation of driver â†’ vehicle â†’ route (Destination Hub)
 
Level 2 â€“ Intermediate Development
 
 a) Integrate OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js for map visualization.
 
 b) Add OSRM for route optimization.
 
 c) Generate stock and vehicle reports.
 
 d) Notification system for stock, vehicle availability, and driver assignment.
 
Level 3 â€“ Advanced Development (Future Enhancements)
 
 a) Real-time tracking of vehicles (using GPS integration if available).
 
 b) Predictive stock management (using machine learning for demand forecasting).
 
 c) Advanced analytics dashboard with charts and insights.
 
 d) Multi-user roles (Admin, Inventory Manager, Driver).
 
âœ… This way, your Smart-Inventory system grows step by step:
 
Start simple with stock + vehicle + driver.
 
Then integrate routing with free/open tools.
 
Finally, add AI, reports, and real-time features.
